# 🧮 BCG Data Science Virtual Experience Program

Welcome! This repository contains my work and reflections from completing the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Data Science Virtual Experience Program** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/bcg/data-science-ccdz).

---

## 📊 Program Overview

As part of this simulation, I stepped into the role of a data scientist at **XYZ Analytics**, tackling a real-world inspired business problem: **customer churn analysis**.

## ✅ Key Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ **Customer Churn Analysis**
- Conducted a deep-dive analysis to identify crucial client data and designed a robust strategy to investigate churn drivers.
- Applied **advanced data analytics** concepts to explore, clean, and preprocess the dataset.

### 2️⃣ **Data Processing & Visualization**
- Leveraged **Python**, using libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` for efficient data manipulation.
- Produced clear and compelling visualizations to uncover trends and patterns.

### 3️⃣ **Machine Learning Model Engineering**
- Developed and optimized a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn probability.
- Achieved a **50% recall rate**, demonstrating effective identification of at-risk customers.

### 4️⃣ **Business Impact**
- Delivered a concise **executive summary** translating technical findings into actionable business insights.
- Outlined strategic recommendations to help stakeholders make informed, data-driven decisions.
